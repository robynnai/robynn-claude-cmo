## Example: Robynn Brand Hub One-Pager

```markdown
# Robynn Brand Hub
> Your brand guidelines, live and working — not gathering dust.

---

## The Challenge

Your brand guidelines exist. But nobody uses them.

Every new piece of content starts with the same questions: "What's our tone again?" "Can I use this word?" "Does this sound like us?"

**What this costs you:**
- Hours per week re-explaining brand to writers and contractors
- Inconsistent content that confuses customers
- Revision cycles that kill your velocity

---

## The Solution

Robynn Brand Hub turns your static brand guide into a living system. Any writer — human or AI — can tap into your brand instantly.

**Key capabilities:**
- ✓ Brand voice that's always up-to-date and accessible
- ✓ Auto-review content for brand consistency
- ✓ Works with Claude, ChatGPT, and your existing tools

---

## Formatting Rules

1. **Scannable in 60 seconds** - Use headers, bullets, and white space
2. **One page** - If printing, it fits on one page
3. **Specific > Vague** - Numbers and proof points, not adjectives
4. **Their problem first** - Don't lead with features
5. **Single CTA** - One clear next step

---

## Common Variations

### Feature-Specific One-Pager
Focus on a single feature for a specific use case. Good for enterprise deals where different stakeholders care about different things.

### Competitor Comparison One-Pager
Side-by-side comparison with a specific competitor. Be honest but strategic about what you compare.

### Use Case One-Pager
Same product, but framed for a specific persona or industry. Same features, different problem framing.
