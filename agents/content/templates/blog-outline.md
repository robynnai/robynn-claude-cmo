## Example Outline

```markdown
# How to Build a Brand Voice Guide That Actually Gets Used

## Introduction
Hook: Most brand voice guides get created, shared once, then forgotten in a Google Drive folder. 
Promise: This post shows how to build one that your team will actually reference daily.
Credibility: Based on analyzing 50+ brand guides and building our own at Robynn.

## The Problem With Traditional Brand Guides
- Too long (nobody reads 40 pages)
- Too vague ("be authentic" means nothing)
- Not connected to actual work
- Example: [specific bad brand guide pattern]

## The One-Page Brand Voice Framework
- Core voice attributes (max 4)
- Words we use / don't use
- Tone by context (not one-size-fits-all)
- Real examples, not abstract descriptions

## How to Roll It Out (So People Actually Use It)
- Integrate into templates, not just docs
- Reference in feedback (not just creation)
- Update based on what resonates
- Make it findable (not buried)

## Common Mistakes That Kill Adoption
- Making it too long
- Writing it in committee
- Forgetting to update it

## Conclusion
Summary: Short, specific, integrated into workflow.
CTA: Download our one-page brand voice template.
