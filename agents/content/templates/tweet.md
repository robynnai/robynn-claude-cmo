```
Your brand guidelines aren't too detailed. They're too boring.

The best ones read like a manifesto, not a rulebook.
```

They create more systems for content.
```

## Formatting Rules

1. One idea per tweet
2. Line breaks for emphasis (but don't overdo)
3. No hashtags unless truly relevant (#buildinpublic is fine)
4. Emojis sparingly (0-2 max)
5. Links at the end, not middle

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

❌ Multiple ideas crammed in
❌ "THREAD 🧵" on a standalone tweet
❌ Hashtag spam (#marketing #startup #ai #growth #tech)
❌ Starting with "So..."
❌ Generic motivation ("Believe in yourself!")
❌ Engagement bait ("Like if you agree")
❌ "RT if..." (comes across desperate)
