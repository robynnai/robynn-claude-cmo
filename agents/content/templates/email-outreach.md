## Cold Outreach Email

### Variables to Fill

- **Recipient:** [Name, role, company]
- **Personalization hook:** [Something specific about them]
- **Relevance:** [Why them, why now?]
- **Value prop:** [What's in it for them?]
- **Ask:** [Single clear CTA]

---

### Template

```
Subject: [Specific, curiosity-driven, NOT salesy]

Hi [First name],

[One sentence personalized observation - something you noticed about them, their company, or their work. NOT generic flattery.]

[One sentence on why you're reaching out to THEM specifically - the connection to what you do.]

[1-2 sentences on what's in it for them - specific value, not vague promises.]

[Single clear ask - usually a meeting, but be specific on time ask.]

[Simple signature - name, one line, no 10-line footers]
```

---

### Example

```
Subject: Your recent post on brand consistency

Hi Sarah,

Saw your LinkedIn post about struggling to keep content on-brand across 5 contractors - felt that pain at my last company.

We built Robynn specifically for this: it's like a brand brain that any writer (human or AI) can tap into.

Two customers with similar setups cut their revision cycles by 60%. Happy to show you how in 15 minutes if useful.

Free Thursday afternoon?

## Newsletter Email

### Variables to Fill

- **Issue topic:** [Main theme]
- **Key insight:** [The one thing they should remember]
- **CTA:** [What should they do?]

---

### Template

```
Subject: [Value-driven, specific to this issue]

[Opening hook - what's in this issue and why it matters NOW]

---

[Main insight or story]

[2-3 paragraphs max - one idea, well-explained]

**Key takeaway:**
[Bullet or bold the main point]

---

[CTA - one clear action]

```

---

### Example

```
Subject: The brand guide hack nobody talks about

Most brand guides fail for one reason: they describe the voice, they don't demonstrate it.

---

I reviewed 50+ brand guides last month. The ones that actually get used all had this in common:

**They show, don't tell.**

Instead of "Our voice is friendly and approachable," the good ones say:

✓ Write: "Got it! Here's what happens next..."
✗ Don't write: "Your request has been received and is being processed."

That's the difference between a guide and a reference.

---

**This week's action:**

Pick one section of your brand guide. Add a "Write this / Don't write this" example for each principle.

Takes 15 minutes. Makes the whole guide 10x more useful.

---

Hit reply and tell me: does your brand guide have real examples, or is it all abstract?

— Madhukar

P.S. We just shipped example generation in Robynn. It'll create "Write/Don't write" pairs for any brand voice. Worth a look if you're updating your guide.

## Follow-Up Email

### Rules

1. Keep it SHORT (3-4 sentences max)
2. Add new value (don't just "bump")
3. Make it easy to respond

### Template

```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

[One new piece of value or context - reason for following up beyond "checking in"]

[Reiterate the core ask in one sentence]

[Make it easy: "If [day] doesn't work, just say when does."]

— [Name]
```

### Example

```
Subject: Re: Your recent post on brand consistency

Hi Sarah,

Just shipped a case study on how [similar company] solved the exact contractor consistency issue you mentioned. Happy to share if useful.

Still up for a 15-min chat this week?

If not, no worries - I know Q4 is chaos.
