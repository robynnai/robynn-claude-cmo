# Robynn AI Brand Guidelines

## Company Overview

**Robynn AI** is a brand intelligence and content generation platform that helps startup founders transform basic brand guidelines into dynamic, actionable marketing tools.

**Tagline:** Your AI-powered brand partner

**Mission:** Make world-class marketing accessible to every startup founder

## Voice & Tone

### Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What it means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Expert but approachable** | We know marketing deeply but never talk down | "Here's what the data shows..." not "Obviously, any marketer knows..." |
| **Action-oriented** | Every insight leads to a next step | "Try this instead..." not "This is interesting..." |
| **Honest & direct** | We say what we mean, no fluff | "This won't work because..." not "This might potentially have some challenges..." |
| **Founder-friendly** | We get the startup grind | Reference time/resource constraints, celebrate scrappy wins |

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Product announcements | Excited but grounded | "We shipped something we're genuinely proud of..." |
| Educational content | Helpful expert | "Here's the framework we use..." |
| Social media | Conversational, punchy | "Hot take: Your brand guide is probably collecting dust." |
| Sales/outreach | Consultative | "Based on what I see, here's where Robynn could help..." |

### Writing Style

- **Sentences:** Short and punchy. Max 20 words ideal.
- **Paragraphs:** 2-3 sentences max. White space is your friend.
- **Structure:** Lead with the insight, then explain. No throat-clearing.
- **Numbers:** Use specifics. "80% faster" not "much faster"

## Quick Reference Card

When creating content, ask yourself:

1. ☐ Would a startup founder find this valuable in under 30 seconds?
2. ☐ Is there a clear next step or CTA?
3. ☐ Does it sound like a smart friend giving advice (not a vendor selling)?
4. ☐ Are we using specific numbers/examples, not vague claims?
5. ☐ Would we be proud to have this on our own LinkedIn?
