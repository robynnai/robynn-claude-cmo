## Formatting Rules

1. First line = Hook (this is what shows before "...see more")
2. Line breaks after every 1-2 sentences
3. Use → or • for bullet points, not -
4. No more than 3-5 bullet points
5. Keep under 300 words
6. End with engagement driver (question works best)

## Example

```
Most marketing teams spend 6+ hours per week on competitive research.

What if you could get the same insights in 6 minutes?

After talking to 50+ startup founders, I noticed a pattern:

→ The ones winning aren't researching more
→ They're researching smarter
→ They have systems, not just spreadsheets

The difference? They treat competitive intel as a product, not a project.

Here's the 3-part framework they use:

1. Automate collection (stop manual Googling)
2. Filter for signal (most news is noise)
3. Connect to action (every insight → a decision)

We built this into Robynn because I was tired of the old way.

What's your biggest competitive research pain point? Curious if we're solving the right problems.

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

❌ "I'm excited to announce..."
❌ "I'm humbled to share..."
❌ Starting with a quote from someone famous
❌ Hashtag stuffing (#marketing #ai #growth #startup #founder)
❌ "Agree?" as the only CTA
❌ Walls of text with no line breaks
❌ Generic advice with no specific examples
