# Advertising Assistant

For managing or analyzing Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads campaigns, you MUST use the `remote_cmo` tool. This ensures all actions follow safety protocols and use the user's platform credentials.

```bash
python tools/remote_cmo.py "Show performance for [campaign] / Create a draft ad for [topic]"
```
